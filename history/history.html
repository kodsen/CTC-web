            History of CTC Academy
          </h1>
          <p1>
            Christian Teaching Center Academy otherwise known as C.T.C Academy, a mission school,
            founded by Dr. John E. Akpami, began on the 20th of september, 1991.
            Dr. John E. Akpami is the president of the Global Revival Gospel
            Ministries International a.k.a Christian Teaching Center Family Church. A trained medical
            practionioner who resigned to pursue the calling of God in his life, in 1990.
          </p1>
          <h1>
            THE MANDATE
          </h1>
          <p1>
            Christian Teaching Center Academy was inaugurated on the need to attain academic
            excellence without compromising the spiritual lives of the learners. Upon this
            foundation was the school established.
          </p1>
          <p1>
            In 2003, the president related an article "The birth of C.T.C Academy" published
            by the Academy; how that a J.S.S student returned from school one day with some
            occultic books freely distributed to them by one of their teachers. He explained
            further, how that one of the books taught innocent students how to build simple
            alters (shrines) by their bedsides.
          </p1>
          <p1>
            The birth of C.T.C Academy was to prevent students from earning distinctions and
            credits at the expense of their souls. C.T.C Academy was birthed to ensure that
            students do not end up being initiated into cult groups
            in pursuit of education.
          </p1>
          <h1>
            THE VISION
          </h1>
          <p1>
            To raise future leaders with academic soundness under a strong spiritual
            covering.
          </p1>
          <h1>
            THE MOTTO
          </h1>
          <P1>
            With Jesus i will make it.
          </P1>
          <h1>
            THE INCEPTION OF THE ACADEMY
          </h1>
          <p1>
            At the inception of the academy in September 20th 1999, the school had only the
            the nursery and primary sections, headed by Mr. Ezra Cirang. As Head master,
            Mr. Ezra was appointed to oversee and grow the school made up of 32 pupils and a few staff.
          </p1>
          <p1>
            One year later in September 2000, the secondary section of the school took off with
            15 J.S.S 1 students. Following this development, Mr. Ezra was then appointed the
            Principal of the Academy, to oversee the various sections of the school. To help
            the newly appointed Principal take the school to a greater height, few more teachers
            were employed.
          </p1>
          <p1>
            At this point, basic and essential facilities were put in place for
            proper and smooth running of the school. Mr. Ezra had hardly began the registration of
            the school with the appropriate educational authorities when he resigned his appointment
            with the school in December 2002, to pursue his political ambition.
          </p1>
          <p1>
            It was at this point that Mrs. Edna Onyenobi with a Masters Degree in English Language
            was appointed Principal, to take up the task of taking CTC Academy to its promised land.
            In December 2002, when Mrs. Edna took over the leadership of the Academy as Principal, the
            school had about 55 students already registered in the secondary school and 77 students in
            the nursery and primary school. With about 15 teachers, she was to steer the Academy to a
            greater height.
          </p1>
          <p1>
            Notably among her first achievements as the Principal of the school was the registration of the
            school with the Kaduna State Education Authority, which also approved a J.S.S Examination
            Center for the school. This was very timely because the school at this point had progressed to
            J.S.S 3 class, ready to write Junior WAEC. In 2004, following the graduation of students
            from J.S.S 3 to S.S 1, it became necessary for additional classrooms to be provided. This was what
            informed the building of more classrooms in October of the same year.
          </p1>
          <p1>
            In October 2008, the Academy got accredited as NECO and WAEC centres. Following
            this development, update of facilities of the Academy became necessary. Hence, 
            the construction of the science laboratory.
            . In 2009,  S.S 3 students of the school were set to write their WAEC and NECO Examinations.
            Following the progress the school was making, in 2009, the Parents Teachers Association (P.T.A)
            body which was inaugurated at the inception of the school, suddenly jerked to life with a move to
            build a library for the school.
