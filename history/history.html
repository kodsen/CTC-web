            History of CTC Academy
          </h1>
          <p>
            Christian Teaching Center Academy otherwise known as C.T.C Academy
            began on the 20th of September, 1991, as a mission school. The founder of the
            Academy is Dr. John E. Akapmi. He is the president of the Global Revival Gospel
            Ministries International a.k.a Christian Teaching Center Family Church. A trained medical
            practionioner who resigned to pursue the calling of God in his life, in 1990.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr J.E Akpami has an Apostolic ministry with evidence of a ground-breaking,
            record-breaking, destiny-shaping and life-changing impact. His unique style of
            ministration makes the supernatural a common place. There is no doubt that
            Dr. J.E Akpami is a man sent by God for a time like this to impact his world.
            We are indeed proud to be part of his ministry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. J.E Akpami is happily married to his beloved wife, friend and co-minister,
            Pastor Clara Akpami, who is a member of the governing board of C.T.C Academy.
            Together, they are blessed with two children: Eunice and Paul. Dr. J.E Akpami and
            his wife live in Zaria, Nigeria, from where they are fulfilling their life's
            purposes.
          </p>
          <h1>
            THE MANDATE
          </h1>
          <p>
            Christian Teaching Center Academy was inaugurated on the need to attain academic
            excellence without compromising the spiritual lives of the learners. Upon this
            foundation was the school established.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2003, the president related an article "The birth of C.T.C Academy" published
            by the Academy; how that a J.S.S student returned from school one day with some
            occultic books freely distributed to them by one of their teachers. He explained
            further, how that one of the books taught innocent students how to build simple
            alters (shrines) by their bedsides.
          </p>
          <p>
            The birth of C.T.C Academy was to prevent students from earning distinctions and
            credits at the expense of their souls. C.T.C Academy was birthed to ensure that
            students do not end up being initiated into the occults and demonic cult groups
            in pursuit of education.
          </p>
          <p>
            To avoid exposing learners to such risk C.T.C Academy has a mandate to provide
            the best education possible under strong spiritual covering. This as a matter of
            urgency, informed the vision of C.T.C Academy.
          </p>
          <h1>
            THE VISION
          </h1>
          <p>
            To raise future leaders with academic soundness under a strong spiritual
            covering.
          </p>
          <h1>
            THE MOTTO
          </h1>
          <P>
            With Jesus i will make it.
          </P>
          <h1>
            THE INCEPTION OF THE ACADEMY
          </h1>
          <p>
            At the inception of the academy in September 20th 1999, the school had only the
            the nursery and primary sections, headed by Mr. Ezra Cirang. As Head master,
            Mr. Ezra was appointed to oversee and grow the 32 pupils and few staff, among which
            were: Mrs. Manji Abu (now Barrister Manji Abu), Miss. Esther O.A., Miss. Comfort
            Oguda (now late) and Mr. Mathew Sule (who was awaiting service in NYSC and offered
            to assist as a teacher).
          </p>
          <p>
            One year later in September 2000, the secondary section of the school took off with
            15 J.S.S 1 students. Following this development, Mr. Ezra was then appointed
            Principal of the Academy, to oversee the various sections of the school. To help
            the newly appointed Principal take the school to a greater height, few more teachers
            were employed.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a means to foster effective management of the school, the President, Dr. J.E Akpami
            constituted a Governing Board of five membership, comprising of Mr S.A Alagbe as Chairman;
            Pastor(Mrs.) Clara Akpami. Pastor Adogbo, Brother Dapo and Mr. Ezra Cirang as the
            Secretary of the Board. This Board was tasked with the responsibility of admission
            regulation, employment of staff and also undertake major decisions that affects the
            school.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, basic and essential facilities were begining to be put in place for
            proper and smooth running of the school. Mr. Ezra had hardly began the registration of
            the school with the appropriate educational authorities when resigned his appointment
            with the school in December 2002, to pursue his political ambition.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was at this point that Mrs. Edna Onyenobi- A Masters Degree in English Language holder,
            was appointed Principal, to take up the task of taking CTC Academy to its promised land.
            In December 2002, when Mrs. Edna took over the leadership of the Academy as Principal, the
            school had about 55 students already registered in the secondary school and 77 students in
            the nursery and primary school. With about 15 teachers, she was to steer the Academy to a
            greater height.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notably among her first achievement as the Principal of the school was the registration of the
            school with the Kaduna State Education Authority, which also approved a J.S.S Examination
            Center for the school. This was very timely because the school at this point had progressed to
            having J.S.S 3 students, ready to write Junior WAEC. In 2004, following the graduation of students
            from J.S.S 3 to S.S 1, it became necessary for additional classrooms to be provided. This was what
            informed the building in October. This building produced three classes with a staffroom. In 2005,
            the building of the examination hall and the computer room began and was completed the same year.
            With the building of the hall came additional classrooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            In October 2008, the Academy got the approval for the conduction of NECO and WAEC Examinations in
            the school premises. By this time, the school was accredited as NECO and WAEC centres. Following
            this development, update of facilities of the Academy became necessary. The scientific lab was
            upgraded to this regard. In 2009, a set of students were set to write their WAEC Examination.
            Following the progress the school was making, in 2009, the Parents Teachers Association (P.T.A)
            body which was inaugurated at the inception of the school, suddenly jerked to life with a move to
            build a library for the school.
          </p>
          <p>
            The body under the Chairmanship of Mr. Tunde Pratt donated the sum of N400,000 for the building
            of the library with a promise to complete it. However, the Academy under the leadership of
            Mrs. Edna Onyenobi-The Principal- went further to complete the building using the school fund. The
            The building was completed in 2010 and had since been put to use as Library.
