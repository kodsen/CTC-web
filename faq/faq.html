              nursery 2, prep, primary 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Then J.S.S 1, 2, 3 and S.S 1, 2 and 3.

            <p1>
              To ensure quality of the learners, the staff frequently undergo seminars,
              and training in various subject matters as it affects the improvement and delivery
              of the teachers. In recent times, the school has partnered with the Centre for
              Learning and Educational Development Advocacy (CLEDA), to train staff termly and
              conduct career counseling for students (once a week for J.S and S.S). With this,
              the teachers are prepared to teach the students using current methodologies.

              Is the school funded by the church?
            </h1>
            <p1>
              The school's main source of income is the school fees paid by its pupils
              and students. At admission of learners, a bank teller is issued of the
              total fees payable to a designated bank. Receipt is issued by the bursar
              when teller copy for the school is submitted. Bank tellers are issued to 
              all learners of the school at the end of each
              school term to enable parents pay their wards fees before the resumption
              of a new term.
            </p1>
            <p1>
              Other sources of income are sales of forms, sales of the school exercise
              books, commission from the sales of published books, etc. All school
              money is payed into the school's bank account with the bank teller kept
              for record purposes. The school is not funded by the church.

              What provision has been put in place with rergards to scholarship?
            </h1>
            <p1>
              The church and the proprietor of the school gives scholarship to orphans and some indigent
              members of the church who are in the academy. Beneficiaries do not pay tuition. They only
              pay other fees. All pastors children, irrespective of their church affiliation have a discount
              of 20% on tuition. Other fees are paid in full. All staff of the schools are also beneficiaries
              of this largess.

              Why is the school's motto "with Jesus i will make it"?
            </h1>
            <p1>
              Through thick and thin, the Academy has not lost touch of its vision. There's no exaggerating
              the fact that the wind of life has blown on the Academy; the storms of life has also hit it
              and the rain of life has poured down heavily too. Yet through the fires and through the waters,
              the Academy is not moved because its foundation is Jesus- a solid foundation.
            </p1>
            <p1>
              Little wonder the motto of the school is "With Jesus I Will Make It". Sure, with Jesus, the
              Academy and its learners will achieve their vision.

              What advice does the management of the school have for the general public whose wards are
              not in C.T.C Academy?
            </h1>
            <p1>
              What God is doing in C.T.C Academy is visible to the blind and audible to the deaf. For this
              reason, the Academy wishes to make a clarion call to Parents and Guardians living in
              Zaria, who have Children/Wards of school age, to bring their Children for registration.
              The fees of the school is considerably low to give equal opportunity to all children of
              different social classes that exist in the society. Bearing in mind that the Academy is a mission
              school, the fee is no way commensurate with the quality of service rendered.

            <p1>
